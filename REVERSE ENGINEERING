Reverse enginering-
STACK
  -Use the lifo(last in first out methodlogy)
  A section of memory reserved for temporary data storage, managed by the system to support program execution

X86_64 ASSEMBLY - COMMON TERMS
  Heap -Memory that can be allocated and deallocated
  Stack -A contiguous section of memory used for passing arguments
  General Register -A multipurpose register that can be used by either programmer or user to store data or a memory location address
  Control Register -A processor register that changes or controls the behavior of a CPU
  Flags Register -Contains the current state of the processor

X86_64 ASSEMBLY DATA SIZES
  Bit -Smallest unit in computing - 0 or 1
  Nibble  -4 bits/half an octet
  Byte -8 bits
  Word -16 bits
  DWord -32 bits - common
  QWord -64 bits - common

X86_64 ASSEMBLY REGISTERS
  There are 16 general purpose 64-Bit registers
  %rax -the first return register
  %rbp -the base pointer that keeps track of the base of the stack
  %rsp -the stack pointer that points to the top of the stack

X86_64 ASSEMBLY -MEMORY OFFSET
  There is one instruction pointer register that points to the memory offset of the next instruction in the code segment:
  64-Bit	Lower-32bits	Lower-16bits	Descrition
  RIP        EIP            IP         Instruction Pointer; holds address for next instruction to be executed


X86_64 ASSEMBLY - COMMON INSTRUCTION POINTERS
  MOV -move source to destination
  PUSH -push source onto stack
  POP -Pop top of stack to destination
  INC -Increment source by 1
  DEC -Decrement source by 1
  ADD -Add source to destination
  SUB -Subtract source from destination
  CMP -Compare 2 values by subtracting them and setting the %RFLAGS register. ZeroFlag set means they are the same.
  JMP -Jump to specified location
  JLE -Jump if less than or equal
  JE -Jump if equal


X86_64 ASSEMBLY -FLAGS REGISTER
    Flags Register - This register holds the current state of the processor, reflecting the outcomes of various operations and influencing subsequent instructions.
    CF - Carry Flag -Generates a carry or borrow
    ZF - Zero Flag -Set by most instructions if the result of an operation is binary zero
    SF - Sign Flag -Set this bit the same as the most significant bit of the result. 0 = positive, 1 = negative
    OF - Overflow Flag -Set if the result was too large to fit in the designation.


PORTABLE EXECUTEABLE PATCHING/SOFTWARE ANALYSIS
  Perform Debugging and Disassembly
  Find the Success/Failure
  Adjust Instructions
  Apply Patch and Save
  Execute Patched Binary

DEMO 
        C++ basics 
atoi  -ascii to integer
fget -file get stream- receive the input 
strtok -is used for tokenizing a C-style string based on a set of delimiters


1) run the string.exe against the malware  static. another command to run is TYPE to find the type of file. dont really cat binary.
2) run the malwar in a safe environment
3) open in ghidra
4) search for strings in ghidra
5)after you find the string click twice
6) 

                        TO PATCH 
right click press patch instruction cmp to eax to eax   be mindful of which directory it saving to.
