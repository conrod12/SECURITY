Reverse enginering-
STACK
  -Use the lifo(last in first out methodlogy)
  A section of memory reserved for temporary data storage, managed by the system to support program execution

X86_64 ASSEMBLY - COMMON TERMS
  Heap -Memory that can be allocated and deallocated
  Stack -A contiguous section of memory used for passing arguments
  General Register -A multipurpose register that can be used by either programmer or user to store data or a memory location address
  Control Register -A processor register that changes or controls the behavior of a CPU
  Flags Register -Contains the current state of the processor

X86_64 ASSEMBLY DATA SIZES
  Bit -Smallest unit in computing - 0 or 1
  Nibble  -4 bits/half an octet
  Byte -8 bits
  Word -16 bits
  DWord -32 bits - common
  QWord -64 bits - common

X86_64 ASSEMBLY REGISTERS
  There are 16 general purpose 64-Bit registers
  %rax -the first return register
  %rbp -the base pointer that keeps track of the base of the stack
  %rsp -the stack pointer that points to the top of the stack

X86_64 ASSEMBLY -MEMORY OFFSET
  There is one instruction pointer register that points to the memory offset of the next instruction in the code segment:
  64-Bit	Lower-32bits	Lower-16bits	Descrition
  RIP        EIP            IP         Instruction Pointer; holds address for next instruction to be executed
